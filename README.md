# FIFO-DESIGN-VERIFICATION



FIFO (First-In First-Out)Design in SystemVerilog This repository contains a synchronous FIFO buffer implemented in SystemVerilog. FIFO follows the First-In First-Out principle, where the earliest written data is read first. The design supports reset, write/read operations, and status flags like full and empty.

Features: Parameterized FIFO depth and data width Supports write, read, reset, full, and empty logic Handles back-to-back read/write operations Testbench included with randomized inputs and status checks

Tools Used: ModelSim – For simulation and debugging Xilinx Vivado – For synthesis and behavioral simulation EDA Playground – For quick testing and online collaboration
